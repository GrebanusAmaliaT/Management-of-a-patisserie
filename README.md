# Management of a patisserie

This project is a web-based application designed to manage the operations of a patisserie. It is connected to an Oracle SQL database and allows efficient management of various aspects such as products, orders, suppliers, recipes, and employees. The application provides a user-friendly web interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The backend functionality is handled by Node.js, which interacts with the database and serves data to the frontend.
